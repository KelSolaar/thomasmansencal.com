                    My name is <span class="bold colorBrightest">Thomas Mansencal</span>
                    aka <em>("Kel Solaar")</em>. I was born the 31 August 1982 in the french Dax city. At the moment I live in Paris with my girlfriend <span class="bold colorBrightest">Aurelia</span>
                    and our chinchilla <span class="bold colorBrightest">Kiwi</span>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm a french Computer Graphics Artist, working in the field since 2003.
                    I started as a <a href="http://demoscene.tv/" rel="openExternalLink"><span class="bold colorBrightest">Demomaker</span></a>
                    in 1997. Our group Fool won the VIP 99 with the <a href="../pictures/changesFool.jpg" rel="openExternalLink"><span class="bold colorBrightest">Changes</span></a>
                    demo. Since then, it has been a real passion that turned into my job. I can't thank enough my grand father for providing me a computer when I was 8 years old and my family that supported me while I was spending so many hours each day front of the screen.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    I have worked in various productions from VFX films, Advertising, Series, Game Cinematics or Illustrations. I like working in teams and helping people here and there, providing development support if needed.

                    I love practising Bodyboard though I didn't had too much time for it recently. As said one of my <a href="http://www.sebr.fr" rel="openExternalLink"><span class="bold colorBrightest">co-worker</span></a>

                <br/>
                <p>
                    I also enjoy doing a lot of Photography whenever I'm on holidays or traveling though I'm running out of time again at the moment.
